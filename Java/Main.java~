 * SAMU
 * 
 * The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and 
 * verification of the results of the paper entitled "A disembodied 
 * developmental robotic agent called Samu B치tfai". It is our hope 
 * that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter 
 * bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
